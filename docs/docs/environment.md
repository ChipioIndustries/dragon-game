# Building the Project

To create a Roblox level to test your changes in, run the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
rojo build default.project.json -o build.rbxl
```

This will generate `build.rbxl` in the root of the project. Open this file in Roblox Studio and then connect to the Rojo server to begin syncing changes.
