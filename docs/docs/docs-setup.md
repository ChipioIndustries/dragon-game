Documentation is a critical resource for making projects easy to maintain. Dragon Game uses Docusaurus, a static site generator. When writing docs, you can preview them on a local development server.

## Requirements

* You must have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Installing Packages

Navigate to the docs folder and use `npm` to install the required packages.

```bash
cd docs
npm ci
```

## Starting Local Server

Run the local development server to preview your docs changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```
